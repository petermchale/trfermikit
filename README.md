`trfermikit` finds SVs (currently only DELs) in a user-supplied set of tandem repeats. 

## Usage

An example of how to use `trfermikit` can be found in `test-trfermikit.sh`. 

## Evaluation 

`test-trfermikit.sh` also includes code used to assess the performance of `trfermikit` 
and `manta` (in both cases relative to a long-read benchmark callset).

## TODO

Create a docker container and nextflow workflow and register both at [dockstore](https://dockstore.org/).
